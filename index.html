        <h2>Career Goal: Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>Ever since I put my first blocks together, I was hooked on the ability to create code that can solve real-world problems. My goal is to become a software engineer, and to achieve it, I plan to use my free time to learn different types of coding while pursuing this career in school through classes like Computer Science Essentials and Computer Science Principles, and more. This career resonates with me as it combines both creativity and logic—creativity I may be lacking in, but that’s part of why it resonates with me. However, logic is one of my strong suits, and using my logic and what I know to solve complex coding situations is my goal.</p>

        <h2>Traits/Skills/Achievements:</h2>
        <p>Throughout my life, I have learned many skills and possess several traits. Some traits that I possess are my straightforwardness and my logical thinking. After testing products under multi-million or multi-billion dollar companies, I have learned that when providing feedback of any kind, I am straightforward in the sense that even if I may hurt their feelings I will tell them what is wrong with their work. As for my logical thinking, I try to apply the basics and other tricks I have learned to try to find out how to solve any problem. Some achievements I have are, testing products under multi-billion and multi-million dollar companies for pay, doing martial arts for around 7 years collectively between muay thai and karate, and I have developed my teamwork and collaborative skills through team esports. Through my work experience I found that I am very critical when it comes to feedback, even the smallest things that may be a hindrance to performance I would say something about it. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the experiences that I've gone through developed traits I never knew I had and shape who I am in order to guide me towards my ambitious goal of software engineer. From all the experiences I've had, from testing products of major companies, honing my martial arts skills, and collaborating in team esports, to applying my logical and critical approaches to problem-solving, each experience reflects my personal and professional growth. My want to code and my want to solve problems reflect both my commitment to learning and logical mindset. </p>
